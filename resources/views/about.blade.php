<h1>About</h1>
<p>
    My name is Klaus Donnert. This website is an example of some of the work that I can do.
    There is nothing really fancy here, just some demo sites to showcase some of my work.
    This site is built with Laravel 5.5 on a small LEMP server hosted in the cloud at Digitalocean.
    It uses Laravel Forge to pull updates from Github. The source code is located at
    <a href="https://github.com/klaus-donnert/basicwebsite">https://github.com/klaus-donnert/basicwebsite</a>.
    It was a part of a set of projects in the Udemy course "projects in laravel learn laravel building 10 projects".
    I believe in learning by doing so, I built them all and hosted them on my server. Quite honestly, Laravel is
    a sweet MVC framework. It takes care of the plumbing so that I can spend my time working on my code rather
    than sql etc.
