    <h1>iDispatcher GPS</h1>
    <p>iDispatcher GPS is a mobile app that is used by taxicab drivers for GPS based dispatching. Drivers receive a push notification
    when a customer is needing a taxi. Think Uber lite - very lite.</p>
    <p>You may download it, but it's not very useful without login credentials. Todo - make a demo backend.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Todo - add download links and logo</p>
